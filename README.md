## Portuguese Tax Authority Waybill

Portuguese tax authority (called AT) demands that waybills be reported to them.
Using a secure channel, waybill details are transfered and in exchange AT returns
a unique code (that should be printed in the waybill).

This code allows anyone with a certificate and valid credentials to build a waybill
from scratch and report it to AT. If everything goes smoothly the unique code is
returned.
